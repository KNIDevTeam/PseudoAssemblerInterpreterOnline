If the label is associated with an array, it points to its first memory block.</li><li><b>[label]([register])</b> - The interpreter will work on the memory block whose address is equal to the sum of the address pointed at by the label and the address stored in the given register.</li><li><b>[memory address]</b> - The interpreter will work on the memory block with the given address. </li><li><b>[memory address]([register])</b> - The interpreter will work on the memory block whose address is equal to the sum of the given address and the address stored in the given register.</li></ul><p>All these ways are, ultimately, ways of achieving the same objective - accessing a memory block.</p><h4>Example</h4><p>Suppose we declared two arrays VEC1{1, 2} and VEC2{3, 4} (both size of 2 integers).<br>Conveniently, we also prepared registers - REG1{0} and REG2{4}. (Notice that 4 is the size of integer in bytes)<br>Now let's analyse the memory addresses utilised by our arrays:<pre>VEC1[0] = 1 | address: 0<br>VEC1[1] = 2 | address: 4<br>VEC2[0] = 3 | address: 8<br>VEC2[1] = 4 | address: 12</pre>The Following commands once executed will compute the sum of values stored in VEC1 and VEC2 and save it in REG1:<p></p><pre>A   1, VEC1<br>A   1, VEC1(2)<br>A   1, 8 <br>A   1, 8(2)</pre></p>"
